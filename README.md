# Redrawing picture black and white
User can upload a pic and my program redoes the picture in black and white

You need to have downloaded numpy, cv2, and PyQt5 for this application to work.
It showns some errors but runs correctly enough.
It still crashes if you exit during photoselection.
Otherwise it does black and white image perfectly and displays both, the original and edited, pictures on screen.
You might need to adjust system window screen to fit all the pictures and my computer is 1920x1080 and I have used those values
while I've been making this.
